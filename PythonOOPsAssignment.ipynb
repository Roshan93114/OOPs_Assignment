        "##Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming style that is based on the concept of “objects.” These objects can contain data, in the form of variables (called attributes), and code, in the form of functions (called methods). The main idea of OOP is to structure programs in a way that models real-world things and behaviors. OOP helps in organizing large and complex code in a simpler and reusable way. It improves code readability and allows programmers to build systems that are easier to manage and extend. The four main principles of OOP are:\n",

        "For example, in a school management system, a “Student” object can have attributes like name, age, and grade, and methods like attend_class() and give_exam(). This helps make the code feel more real and understandable."

        "Ans- A class in Object-Oriented Programming is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines what properties (data/variables) and behaviors (methods/functions) an object will have. Just like a blueprint of a house can be used to build many similar houses, a class can be used to create multiple objects. The class doesn’t store any actual data; it only describes how the data should be structured. Once a class is defined, we can create multiple objects (also called instances) from it. These objects will have the properties and methods defined in the class. For example, consider a class called Car. It might have attributes like color, brand, and speed, and methods like drive() and brake(). From this class, we can create different car objects like Honda, Toyota, or BMW, each with their own values."

        "Ans- An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has some properties and can perform certain actions. When we create a class in OOP, we are just defining how something should be structured. When we use that class to create something, we are making an object. Objects hold actual values and can use the methods defined in their class. Each object is independent and has its own copy of data, but it shares the same structure as defined by the class. For example, if Dog is a class, then dog1 and dog2 can be two objects of that class. They both can bark, walk, and eat (methods), but one may be a Labrador and the other a German Shepherd (different attribute values)."

        "Ans- Abstraction and encapsulation are two key ideas in Object-Oriented Programming, but they serve different purposes. Abstraction is about hiding the internal details and only showing the necessary parts to the user. It helps in focusing on what an object does, rather than how it does it. For example, when you use a mobile phone, you press buttons to call, but you don’t need to know how the internal circuit works. Encapsulation is about binding the data and methods together into a single unit (class), and keeping some parts private so that they can’t be accessed directly from outside. This protects the data and ensures only safe interactions with the object. In simple words, abstraction is about hiding complexity, while encapsulation is about protecting data. Both are used to make code secure, clean, and easy to manage."

        "Ans- Dunder methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores (__).  The word \"dunder\" is short for double underscore. These methods are automatically called by Python in certain situations and allow us to define how our objects behave with operators or built-in functions. For example , __init__() is a dunder method used to initialize objects when they are created. Similarly, __str__() is used to define how the object should be printed as a string, and __add__() can be used to define how objects should be added using the + operator. Dunder methods help in operator overloading and making objects behave in a more natural or Pythonic way. For example, if we have a class Book, we can use __str__() to display book details nicely when we print the object."

        "##Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Ans- Inheritance is a feature in Object‑Oriented Programming that lets one class (called the child or derived class) reuse the code of another class (called the parent or base class). By inheriting, the child class automatically gets the parent’s attributes and methods, which saves us from writing the same code again. We can also add new features or change existing ones in the child class. This helps create a natural “is‑a” relationship and forms a clear class hierarchy. There are different types of inheritance such as single, multilevel, and multiple inheritance. When a program grows large, inheritance keeps it organized and reduces errors because any fix in the parent class is shared by all its children.\n",
        "Example: A Dog class inheriting from an Animal class automatically gets methods like eat() and sleep(), and can add its own method bark()."

        "##Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism means “many forms.” In OOP, it allows the same method name to act differently on different classes. When we call that method on an object, the correct version runs based on the object’s actual class. This lets us write flexible code that works with different kinds of objects using a single interface. Polymorphism comes in two main forms: compile‑time (method overloading, more common in languages like Java) and run‑time (method overriding, common in Python). Because of polymorphism, we can store objects of different classes in the same list or call the same method in a loop and trust each object to handle itself properly.\n",

        "##Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and code (methods) inside one class and keeping certain details hidden from the outside world. In Python, we use name conventions to control access. Attributes without underscores are public and can be reached directly. A single underscore (like _temp) signals that the attribute is protected and should be treated as internal. A double underscore (like __balance) makes the attribute private, and Python changes its name internally to prevent direct access. We then create public methods—often called getters and setters—to read or change these hidden attributes safely. This protects data from accidental changes and ensures that any modification happens through controlled methods where we can add checks.\n",
        "* Example: In a BankAccount class, __balance is private; money can be added only through deposit() and removed only through withdraw()."

        "ANs- A constructor is a special method that Python calls automatically each time we create a new object from a class. The constructor’s name is __init__. Inside __init__, we set up the object’s initial state by assigning values to its attributes or running any startup code. Because the constructor runs immediately upon object creation, it saves us from writing extra lines to initialize each object later. We can also pass arguments to the constructor to customize each object’s data on creation.\n",
        "* Example: In a Student class, __init__(self, name, roll) stores the student’s name and roll number right away when we write s = Student(\"Anita\", 37).\n",

        "##Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans- A class method is declared with the @classmethod decorator and takes cls (the class itself) as the first parameter. It can read or change class‑level variables that are shared by all objects. We call a class method using either the class name or an object. A static method is declared with @staticmethod and takes no automatic first argument (self or cls). It behaves like a regular function placed inside the class for logical grouping. Static methods can be called on the class or an object but cannot change class or instance data directly without extra parameters. Both methods help organise code: class methods work with class data; static methods provide utility functions related to the class.\n",

        "Ans- Method overloading means having multiple methods in a class with the same name but different number or type of arguments. In some languages like Java or C++, method overloading is supported directly. But in Python, this is not possible in the traditional way. Python allows only the last defined method with the same name to stay active.\n",

        "Ans- Method overriding means defining a method in the child class that already exists in the parent class, but changing its behavior. This is a part of runtime polymorphism. When we call the method using an object of the child class, Python will run the overridden method, not the one in the parent class.\n",
        "This helps when the parent class gives a general method, but the child class needs to make it more specific.\n",

        "##Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism means “one interface, many forms.” In Python, it shows up when different child classes inherit the same parent and override a common method.\n",
        "A piece of code can then call that method on any object from the family without caring about its exact class.\n",
        "At run time, Python looks at the object’s real class and picks the correct overridden method—a process called dynamic dispatch.\n",
        "This lets us write flexible loops that treat mixed objects uniformly, improving code reuse and readability.\n",
        "Polymorphism also appears in built‑in functions like len(), which works on strings, lists, and dictionaries because each type provides its own __len__ method.\n",
        "Unlike languages that need method overloading, Python leans on duck typing: “if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, treat it as a duck.”\n",
        "So long as the required method exists, polymorphism works, even without a shared parent class—though inheritance keeps things organized.\n",
        "Overall, polymorphism reduces if‑else chains, makes code shorter, and supports open‑ended design where new classes plug in easily."

        "Ans- Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called one after another in a single line of code. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (self). It makes the code shorter and cleaner.\n",

        "Ans-  __call__ is a special (dunder) method that allows an object to behave like a function.\n",
        "When we place parentheses after an object—obj()—Python checks whether the class defines __call__.\n",
        "If it does, that method runs, letting us execute custom code as though the object itself were a function.\n",
        "This feature is handy for making configurable function objects or lightweight stateful decorators.\n",
        "For instance, we can store settings in the object during __init__ and then do calculations each time __call__ is used.\n",
        "Since __call__ receives self, it can access and update the object’s internal state on every call, giving us more control than plain functions.\n",
        "Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch rely on __call__ to let model objects act like prediction functions.\n",
        "Using __call__ keeps syntax clean while allowing objects to encapsulate both data and callable behavior."
